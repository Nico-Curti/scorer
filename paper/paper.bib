  abstract = {Background: COVID assessment can be performed using the recently developed individual risk score (prediction of severe respiratory failure in hospitalized patients with SARS-COV2 infection, PREDI-CO score) based on High Resolution Computed Tomography. In this study, we evaluated the possibility of automatizing this estimation using semi-supervised AI-based Radiomics, leveraging the possibility of performing non-supervised segmentation of ground-glass areas. Methods: We collected 92 from patients treated in the IRCCS Sant’Orsola-Malpighi Policlinic and public databases; each lung was segmented using a pre-trained AI method; ground-glass opacity was identified using a novel, non-supervised approach; radiomic measurements were collected and used to predict clinically relevant scores, with particular focus on mortality and the PREDI-CO score. We compared the prediction obtained through different machine learning approaches. Results: All the methods obtained a well-balanced accuracy (70%) on the PREDI-CO score but did not obtain satisfying results on other clinical characteristics due to unbalance between the classes. Conclusions: Semi-supervised segmentation, implemented using a combination of non-supervised segmentation and feature extraction, seems to be a viable approach for patient stratification and could be leveraged to train more complex models. This would be useful in a high-demand situation similar to the current pandemic to support gold-standard segmentation for AI training.},

  abstract = {The two most popular types of graphical model are Bayesian networks (BNs) and Markov random fields (MRFs). These types of model offer complementary properties in model construction, expressing conditional independencies, expressing arbitrary factorizations of joint distributions, and formulating messagepassing inference algorithms. We show how the notation and semantics of factor graphs (a relatively new type of graphical model) can be extended so as to combine the strengths of BNs and MRFs. Every BN or MRF can be easily converted to a factor graph that expresses the same conditional independencies, expresses the same factorization of the joint distribution, and can be used for probabilistic inference through application of a single, simple message-passing algorithm. We describe a modified "Bayes-ball" algorithm for establishing conditional independence in factor graphs, and we show that factor graphs form a strict superset of BNs and MRFs. In particular, we give an example of a commonly-used model fragment, whose independencies cannot be represented in a BN or an MRF, but can be represented in a factor graph. For readers who use chain graphs, we describe a further extension of factor graphs that enables them to represent properties of chain graphs.},
